Progress Tracking of Capstone Project: 

Day 1: Created google docs and created formating for what the site should look like/function. Created basic React on Vscode. 

Day 2: Added routes and styling for Login page. Tested firebase google authentication but errors made things extremely difficult. Ended up 
pausing the authentication and move on to testing the api/database. Got into another error where the .env file was stil being
registered despite being added on .gitignore. Issue fixed once .env was deleted/replaced/and committed.
