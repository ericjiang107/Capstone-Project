Progress Tracking of Capstone Project: 

Day 1: Created google docs and created formating for what the site should look like/function. Created basic React on Vscode. 

Day 2: Added routes and styling for Login page. Tested firebase google authentication but errors made things extremely difficult. Ended up 
pausing the authentication and move on to testing the api/database. Got into another error where the .env file was stil being
registered despite being added on .gitignore. Issue fixed once .env was deleted/replaced/and committed. 

Day 3: Ran into errors where the .env file wasn't being read into the specific files. Had to focus on debugging...
Solution: no idea but after attempting to copy and paste the same word over and over again, it magically worked...
Rested my brain for Day 3. 

Day 4: Updated files and figured out more about how the api works and how to access specific data (i.e. Name, product info, etc). Fixed more bugs 
and made the image surface on the website. Figured out how to showcase the pricing of each card. Styling needs to be 
updated but overall, a lot was done today and I learned a lot about how important creating components is and how we can decrease the 
amount of typing/time using it. 

Day 5: Continued error of setting up firebase google sign-in authentication. Some errors include: Property 'auth' does not exist on type 'typeof import...
or Property 'signInWithPopup' does not exist on type 'Auth'.ts(2339)... and more. Established a better understanding of how to creating
functions and iterating through each data without the need to create new components/lines. Updated one page with more styling and formatting. 
Decided to switch the attention to creating the Home page as I now have a working component that can be dragged in without the need to 
write the code for the images again. Will continue further debugging and figuring out signIn for firebase v9.16.6.
